            <p class="Screen">A <em>capacitive touchscreen</em> panel consists of an insulator, such as glass, coated with a transparent conductor, such as indium tin oxide (ITO).As the human body is also an electrical conductor, touching the surface of the screen results in a distortion of the screen's electrostatic field, measurable as a change in capacitance. Different technologies may be used to determine the location of the touch. The location is then sent to the controller for processing. Touchscreens that use silver instead of ITO exist, as ITO causes several environmental problems due to the use of indium.The controller is typically a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip, which in turn usually sends the signals to a CMOS digital signal processor (DSP) for processing.</p>

            <p class="Screen">In electrical engineering, a <em>resistive touchscreen</em> is a touch-sensitive computer display composed of two flexible sheets coated with a resistive material and separated by an air gap or microdots</p>
            <p class="Screen">There are two different types of metallic layers. The first type is called matrix, in which striped electrodes on substrates such as glass or plastic face each other. The second type is called analogue which consists of transparent electrodes without any patterning facing each other. As of 2011 analogue offered lowered production costs.[citation needed] When contact is made to the surface of the touchscreen, the two sheets are pressed together. On these two sheets there are horizontal and vertical lines that, when pushed together, register the precise location of the touch. Because the touchscreen senses input from contact with nearly any object (finger, stylus/pen, palm) resistive touchscreens are a type of "passive" technology.</p>
